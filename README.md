# CountWords
Working with Wikipedia's API, the "CountWords" API calculates the word occurrence frequency in the provided text.

The "CountWords" API efficiently calculates the occurrence frequency of words in the retrieved text, counting their repetitions regardless of upper or lower case and accounting for special characters or numbers. It treats each unique sequence of characters as a word, including non-alphabetic characters, and accurately counts their repetitions. For instance, if the number "5" is included in the input text, the API will return the number of times it was repeated within the text.
